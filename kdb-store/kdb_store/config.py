"""Connection and cache configuration.

Precedence for most settings: OpenBB credential > environment variable >
default.

Two settings are deliberately outside that chain and take NO credential:

- ``qhome`` is read from ``QHOME`` (else ``/opt/kx``) exactly once per process,
  before ``import pykx`` can rewrite the variable -- see ``_qhome_once``. A
  per-request credential could not be honoured without reintroducing the
  ambiguity that resolution exists to remove.
- ``qlic`` is read from ``QLIC``, falling back to ``qhome``. It points at the
  operator's bring-your-own licence mount, which is a property of the container
  rather than of any caller's credentials.
