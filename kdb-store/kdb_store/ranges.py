"""Date-range arithmetic for the read-through cache.

Pure functions, no I/O. This is what decides that a 1y->3y zoom fetches two
years rather than three, so it carries the bulk of the extension's tests.

Ranges are (start, end) with BOTH ends inclusive. `step` is one bar width: two
ranges separated by exactly one step are adjacent and coalesce, and a gap's
boundary is pulled in by one step so it does not re-request a covered bar.
