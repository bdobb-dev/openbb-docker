"""Every q statement the cache issues.

Kept in one module so the q surface is auditable and mockable in one place.

Five measured facts shape this file:
  * `heap`, not `used`, is what approaches `wmax` and kills q, so eviction
    watches heap.
  * `delete` frees `used` but leaves `heap` untouched; only `.Q.gc[]` returns
    it. Every eviction therefore ends in a collect.
  * `upsert` matches column types EXACTLY -- an incoming column whose q type
    differs from the stored one raises `'type`, it is not coerced -- while
    pandas re-infers each column's dtype from the values of whichever batch
    it is handed. Every write therefore conforms the batch to the stored
    table's schema first; see `_conform_dtypes`.
  * q binds `x`/`y`/`z` as implicit parameters only INSIDE a lambda. A bare
    `conn("... where sym = x", sym)` sends an expression that references an
    unbound `x` and q answers `'x` -- which the cache catches and degrades to
    a bypass, so the whole cache silently did nothing while looking healthy.
    Every parameterised statement here is therefore an explicit-parameter
    lambda `{[qwlo;qwhi] ...}`. Inside a `select`/`delete`, a lambda
    parameter whose name matches a column is silently SHADOWED by that
    column -- the query keeps running and returns wrong rows, no error. This
    isn't just `.cache.cov`/`.cache.lru` (`sym`, `iv`, `s`, `e`, `atime`,
    fixed schemas this code controls): bar-table columns come from whatever
    an upstream data provider returns (`cache.py` renames only the timestamp
    column to `t`), so a short parameter name like `a` or `b` can collide
    with a real provider column with no warning. Every parameter name here
    is therefore namespaced under the `qw` prefix (`_PARAM_PREFIX` below) --
    a string no market-data provider would ever emit as a column name -- so
    the whole class of collision is closed, not patched case by case.
  * An UNGROUPED aggregate (`min`/`max` with no `by`) always returns exactly
    one row, even over zero matching input rows, and PyKX's `.pd()` turns that
    row's q null timestamp into a bogus 1700s-era `Timestamp` rather than
    `NaT` -- so `pd.isna()` cannot detect "no data" after the fact. Found live
    by `scripts/tick_check.py` against a real q: `prune_ticks` correctly
    emptied `trades`, but the next `tick_span` call, on an empty table,
    returned a fabricated span instead of `None`. See `tick_span` for the fix
    (check the row count in q before aggregating, not the pandas result after).

Nothing in here may run off the session's owner thread -- see session.py.
Every query, every K-object construction (`_q_symbol`, `_q_timestamp`) and
every conversion back to Python (`.py()`, `.pd()`) happens inside a callable
handed to `session.run()`.

    the other side of the boundary, infers each column's dtype from the values
    in ONE batch -- so the same provider column arrives as float64 in a batch
    that carries values and as object in a batch where every value is None
    (an all-None column has no dtype to infer), and an int64 volume column
    arrives as float64 in any batch holding a NaN. Whichever batch is written
