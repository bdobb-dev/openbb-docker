# matches column types EXACTLY -- it raises rather than coercing -- while
# pandas re-infers each column's dtype from the values of whichever batch it
# is handed. The first batch above fixed nothing (the schema is declared), but
# a batch whose columns infer DIFFERENTLY is what actually goes over the wire
# in production: a live feed's second flush is small, and a small flush is
# exactly the one whose size column is all-null (object, not float64) and
# whose prices happen to be whole numbers (int64, not float64).
#
# No mock can catch this: a fake connection accepts any dtype. Only a real q
# says 'type.

# --- read_ticks tie-break ---------------------------------------------------

# being a STABLE sort so that ticks sharing one `time` come out in arrival

# query text rather than actually sorting. Two ticks, one timestamp, written
# in arrival order: the later arrival must come back first.
